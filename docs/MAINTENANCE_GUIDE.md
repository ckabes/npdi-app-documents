### 5.2 MERN Stack Architecture

The NPDI Portal follows the MERN stack pattern:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      Web Browser                         │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**How It Works:**
1. User interacts with the React frontend in their browser
2. Frontend sends API requests to the Express backend
3. Backend processes requests, validates data, and queries MongoDB
4. MongoDB returns data to the backend
5. Backend formats the response and sends it to the frontend
6. Frontend updates the user interface with the data

### 5.4 Client-Server Relationship

**Request Flow Example - Creating a Ticket:**

```
User Action: Clicks "Create Ticket" button
     │
     ▼
React Component (CreateTicket.jsx)
     │ Collects form data
     │ Validates input
     ▼
API Service (productAPI.js)
     │ Makes POST request to /api/products
     │ Includes ticket data in request body
     ▼
Express Server (products.js route)
     │ Receives request
     │ Validates authentication
     │ Validates request data
     ▼
Controller (productController.js)
     │ Business logic
     │ Looks up current user
     │ Creates ticket data object
     ▼
Model (ProductTicket.js)
     │ Mongoose schema validation
     │ Saves to MongoDB
     ▼
MongoDB Database
     │ Stores ticket document
     │ Returns saved document
     ▼
Controller
     │ Formats response
     │ Sends success response
     ▼
API Service
     │ Receives response
     │ Returns data to component
     ▼
React Component
     │ Updates UI
     │ Shows success message
     │ Navigates to ticket details
     ▼
User sees: "Ticket created successfully!"
```

### 5.5 Data Flow Diagram

**Authentication Flow:**
```
Profile Selection → AuthContext → Local Storage → All Components
                                  ↓
                         Sets user state globally
                                  ↓
                    Protected routes check user role
                                  ↓
                  Renders appropriate dashboard/pages
```

**Data Fetching Flow:**
```
Component Mounts
    │
    ├─→ useEffect hook triggers
    │       │
    │       ├─→ Calls API service function
    │       │       │
    │       │       ├─→ axios makes HTTP request
    │       │       │       │
    │       │       │       ├─→ Server receives request
    │       │       │       │       │
    │       │       │       │       ├─→ Controller queries database
    │       │       │       │       │       │
    │       │       │       │       │       ├─→ MongoDB returns data
    │       │       │       │       │       │
    │       │       │       │       ├─── Controller formats response
    │       │       │       │

└── .env                     # Environment configuration
```

### 6.2 Express.js Configuration

**Server Entry Point (`server/index.js`):**

```javascript
// Load environment variables
require('dotenv').config();

// Import dependencies
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const helmet = require('helmet');
const compression = require('compression');
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
const connectDB = require('./config/database');

// Create Express app
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

// Connect to MongoDB
connectDB();

// Apply middleware
app.use(helmet());           // Security headers
app.use(compression());      // Response compression
app.use(cors({...}));        // Cross-origin requests
app.use(express.json());     // Parse JSON bodies
app.use(rateLimit({...}));   // Rate limiting

// Register routes
app.use('/api/products', productRoutes);
app.use('/api/users', userRoutes);
// ... other routes

// Error handling
app.use((error, req, res, next) => {
  // Handle errors
});

// Start server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

**Key Components:**
1. **Environment Loading** - Reads `.env` file
2. **Database Connection** - Connects to MongoDB
3. **Middleware Stack** - Security, parsing, compression
4. **Route Registration** - Maps URLs to handlers
5. **Error Handling** - Catches and responds to errors
6. **Server Startup** - Listens on configured port

### 6.3 Middleware Stack

Middleware functions execute in order for each request:

**1. Security (Helmet)**
- Sets HTTP security headers
- Protects against common vulnerabilities
- Configured in `index.js`

**2. Compression**
- Compresses response bodies
- Reduces bandwidth usage
- Improves performance

**3. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**
```javascript
cors({
  origin: [
    'http://localhost:5173',  // Dev client
    'http://localhost:5174',  // Alternate ports
    process.env.CLIENT_URL    // Production URL
  ],
  credentials: true
})
```
- Allows frontend to make requests
- Configured for multiple environments

**4. Rate Limiting**
```javascript
rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,   // 15 minutes
  max: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 100 : 500,
  message: 'Too many requests'
})
```
- Prevents abuse
- Different limits for dev/production

**5. Body Parsing**
```javascript
app.use(express.json({ limit: '10mb' }));
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true, limit: '10mb' }));
```
- Parses JSON request bodies
- Handles form data
- 10MB size limit

### 6.4 Database Connection

**Configuration (`server/config/database.js`):**

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const connectDB = async () => {
  try {
    const conn = await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI, {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true
    });

    console.log(`MongoDB connected: ${conn.connection.host}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
    process.exit(1);  // Exit if connection fails
  }
};

module.exports = connectDB;
```

**MongoDB URI Format:**
```
mongodb://localhost:27017/npdi-portal
```

**Connection Options:**
- `useNewUrlParser`: Uses new URL parser
- `useUnifiedTopology`: Uses new topology engine

**Error Handling:**
- Logs connection errors
- Exits process if connection fails
- Ensures database is available before serving requests

### 6.5 Environment Configuration

**Environment Variables (`.env` file):**

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=5000                    # Server port number
NODE_ENV=development         # Environment (development/production)

# Database Configuration
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/npdi-portal

# Frontend Configuration
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173

# External API Configuration
PUBCHEM_API_KEY=your_key_here
PALANTIR_API_URL=your_url_here
PALANTIR_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Email Configuration (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
# SMTP email functionality is not currently implemented in the application
# SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
# SMTP_PORT=587
# SMTP_USER=your_email@example.com
# SMTP_PASS=your_password
```

**Usage in Code:**
```javascript
const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
const dbUri = process.env.MONGODB_URI;
const apiKey = process.env.PUBCHEM_API_KEY;
```

**Security Notes:**
- `.env` is in `.gitignore` - never committed
- Use `.env.example` as template
- Keep sensitive values secure
- Different `.env` for each environment

            │                               ├── Dashboard
            │                               ├── TicketList
            │                               ├── CreateTicket

            │                               └── AdminDashboard
```

**Component Types:**

1. **Pages** - Full page views rendered by routes
2. **Layout Components** - Structure and navigation
3. **Form Components** - Input and data entry
4. **Display Components** - Show data (badges, cards, etc.)
5. **Context Providers** - Manage global state

### 7.3 Routing with React Router

**Route Configuration (`App.jsx`):**

```javascript
import { Routes, Route, Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      {/* Public Route */}
      <Route path="/select-profile" element={<ProfileSelection />} />

      {/* Protected Routes */}
      <Route path="/" element={<ProtectedRoute><Layout /></ProtectedRoute>}>
        <Route index element={<Navigate to="/dashboard" />} />
        <Route path="dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
        <Route path="tickets" element={<TicketList />} />
        <Route path="tickets/new" element={<CreateTicket />} />
        <Route path="tickets/:id" element={<TicketDetails />} />
        <Route path="drafts" element={<DraftsView />} />
        <Route path="pm-ops" element={<PMOPSDashboard />} />
        <Route path="admin" element={<AdminDashboard />} />
      </Route>

      {/* Catch-all redirect */}
      <Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/dashboard" />} />
    </Routes>
  );
}
```

**Route Protection:**
```javascript
const ProtectedRoute = ({ children, allowedRoles = [] }) => {
  const { user, loading } = useAuth();

  if (loading) return <Loading />;
  if (!user) return <Navigate to="/select-profile" />;

  if (allowedRoles.length > 0 && !allowedRoles.includes(user.role)) {
    return <Navigate to="/dashboard" />;
  }

  return children;
};
```

**URL Structure:**
- `/select-profile` - Profile selection (public)
- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard (all users)
- `/tickets` - Ticket list (all users)
- `/tickets/new` - Create ticket (managers and PMOps)
- `/tickets/:id` - Ticket details (all users)
- `/drafts` - Draft tickets (PMOps and admin)
- `/pm-ops` - PMOps dashboard (PMOps and admin)
- `/admin` - Admin dashboard (admin only)

### 7.4 State Management Approach

The NPDI Portal uses **React Context** for global state and **component state** for local state.

**Global State (AuthContext):**
```javascript
// utils/AuthContext.jsx
const AuthContext = createContext();

export const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [profiles, setProfiles] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  const selectProfile = (profileId) => {
    const profile = profiles.find(p => p.id === profileId);
    setUser(profile);
    localStorage.setItem('selectedProfile', profileId);
  };

  const logout = () => {
    setUser(null);
    localStorage.removeItem('selectedProfile');
  };

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{
      user,
      profiles,
      loading,
      selectProfile,
      logout,
      isPMOPS: user?.role === 'PM_OPS',
      isAdmin: user?.role === 'ADMIN'
    }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
};

// Usage in components:
const { user, selectProfile, logout, isPMOPS } = useAuth();
```

**Component State:**
```javascript
// Local state for component-specific data
const [tickets, setTickets] = useState([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
```

**State Management Pattern:**
- **Global state**: User authentication, profiles, permissions
- **Component state**: Form data, loading states, UI state
- **Server state**: Data fetched from API (tickets, stats, etc.)

### 7.5 API Client Configuration

**API Service (`services/api.js`):**

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

// Base API client
export const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5000/api',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

// Product/Ticket API methods
export const productAPI = {
  // Get all tickets
  getTickets: (params) => apiClient.get('/products', { params }),

  // Get single ticket
  getTicketById: (id) => apiClient.get(`/products/${id}`),

  // Create ticket
  createTicket: (data) => apiClient.post('/products', data),

  // Update ticket
  updateTicket: (id, data) => apiClient.put(`/products/${id}`, data),

  // Update ticket status
  updateTicketStatus: (id, data) => 
    apiClient.patch(`/products/${id}/status`, data),

  // Add comment
  addComment: (id, content) => 
    apiClient.post(`/products/${id}/comments`, { content }),

  // Get dashboard stats
  getDashboardStats: () => apiClient.get('/products/dashboard/stats'),

  // Export endpoints
  exportPDP: (id) => apiClient.get(`/products/${id}/export-pdp`, {
    responseType: 'blob'
  }),

  exportPIF: (id) => apiClient.get(`/products/${id}/export-pif`, {
    responseType: 'blob'
  }),

  exportData: (id) => apiClient.get(`/products/${id}/export-data`, {
    responseType: 'blob'

## PART 3: CORE FUNCTIONALITY

This part explains the core features and systems that power the NPDI Portal application, including authentication, data models, and API endpoints.

---

### **8. Authentication & Authorization**

The NPDI Portal uses a **profile-based authentication system** designed for development and internal use. There are no traditional usernames or passwords - instead, users select from predefined profiles with different roles and permissions.

#### **8.1 Profile-Based Authentication**

**How It Works:**
1. When the application loads, it fetches available profiles from the backend
2. Users see a profile selection screen showing all active profiles
3. After selecting a profile, the user is "logged in" with that profile's role and permissions
4. Profile selection is stored in localStorage for session persistence

**Development Profiles** (stored in `server/data/devProfiles.json`):
- **John Smith** - Product Manager (PRODUCT_MANAGER role)
- **Sarah Johnson** - PM Ops (PM_OPS role)
- **Mike Wilson** - Admin (ADMIN role)

**Profile Structure:**
```javascript
{
  id: 'product-manager',
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  email: 'john.smith@milliporesigma.com',
  role: 'PRODUCT_MANAGER',
  sbu: 'Life Science',
  isActive: true,
  createdAt: '2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'
}
```

#### **8.2 User Roles**

The application supports three distinct roles, each with different permissions:

| Role | Description | Access Level |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **PRODUCT_MANAGER** | Creates and manages product tickets | Can create/edit tickets, view most data, limited pricing access |
| **PM_OPS** | Operations team, handles SKU assignment and pricing | Can manage SKUs, assign pricing, view drafts, edit status history |
| **ADMIN** | Full system access | Complete access to all features including admin panel |

**Role-Based Permissions** (from `Permission` model):

**PRODUCT_MANAGER:**
- ✅ View/Edit: Tickets, drafts, SKU variants, chemical properties, hazard classification, corpbase data, comments
- ❌ No Access: SKU assignment, pricing data, admin panel
- 👁️ View Only: Status history

**PM_OPS:**
- ✅ View/Edit: Tickets, SKU variants, SKU assignment, pricing data, comments, status history
- 👁️ View Only: Drafts, chemical properties, hazard classification, corpbase data
- ❌ No Access: Admin panel

**ADMIN:**
- ✅ Full Access: All features including admin panel

#### **8.3 AuthContext Implementation**

The authentication system is managed by React Context API in `client/src/utils/AuthContext.jsx`:

**Key Components:**
```javascript
const AuthContext = createContext();

export const AuthProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);          // Current user profile
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);    // Loading state
  const [token, setToken] = useState(null);        // Auth token
  const [profiles, setProfiles] = useState([]);    // Available profiles

  // Fetch profiles from API
  const fetchProfiles = async () => {
    const response = await apiClient.get('/profiles');
    setProfiles(response.data || []);
  };

  // Select a profile (login)
  const selectProfile = (profileId) => {
    const profile = profiles.find(p => p.id === profileId);
    setUser(profile);
    localStorage.setItem('selectedProfile', profileId);
    localStorage.setItem('currentProfileData', JSON.stringify(profile));
  };

  // Logout
  const logout = () => {
    localStorage.removeItem('authToken');
    localStorage.removeItem('user');
    localStorage.removeItem('selectedProfile');
    localStorage.removeItem('currentProfileData');
    setToken(null);
    setUser(null);
  };

  // Exposed values and helpers
  const value = {
    user,
    token,
    profiles,
    loading,
    selectProfile,
    logout,
    refreshProfiles: fetchProfiles,
    isAuthenticated: !!user && !!token,
    isProductManager: user?.role === 'PRODUCT_MANAGER',
    isPMOPS: user?.role === 'PM_OPS',
    isAdmin: user?.role === 'ADMIN'
  };

  return <AuthContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</AuthContext.Provider>;
};
```

**Using AuthContext in Components:**
```javascript
import { useAuth } from '../utils/AuthContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { user, isAdmin, logout } = useAuth();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Welcome, {user.firstName}!</p>
      {isAdmin && <AdminPanel />}
      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### **8.4 Protected Routes**

Routes are protected using the `ProtectedRoute` component defined in `client/src/App.jsx`:

```javascript
const ProtectedRoute = ({ children, allowedRoles = [] }) => {
  const { user, loading } = useAuth();
  
  // Show loading spinner while checking authentication
  if (loading) return <Loading />;
  
  // Redirect to profile selection if not authenticated
  if (!user) return <Navigate to="/select-profile" replace />;
  
  // Check role-based access
  if (allowedRoles.length > 0 && !allowedRoles.includes(user.role)) {
    return <Navigate to="/dashboard" replace />;
  }
  
  return children;
};
```

**Route Protection Examples:**
```javascript
// All authenticated users can access
<Route path="tickets" element={<TicketList />} />

// Only PM_OPS and ADMIN can access
<Route path="pm-ops" element={
  <ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['PM_OPS', 'ADMIN']}>
    <PMOPSDashboard />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />

// Only ADMIN can access
<Route path="admin" element={
  <ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['ADMIN']}>
    <AdminDashboard />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

#### **8.5 Profile Selection Flow**

**Location:** `client/src/pages/ProfileSelection.jsx`

**Visual Flow:**
1. Application loads → Fetches profiles from `/api/profiles`
2. Displays profile selection screen with molecular background
3. Shows each profile with:
   - Profile avatar (initials with color-coded background)
   - Full name
   - Role (formatted: "PRODUCT_MANAGER" → "Product Manager")
4. User clicks a profile → Triggers smooth transition animation
5. Profile is stored in localStorage
6. User is redirected to `/dashboard`

**Profile Colors:**
- Product Manager: Green (bg-green-500)
- PM Ops: Blue (bg-blue-500)
- Admin: Purple (bg-purple-500)

#### **8.6 Backend Profile Endpoint**

**Location:** `server/index.js:57-127`

The `/api/profiles` endpoint serves development profiles:

```javascript
app.get('/api/profiles', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const profilesFile = path.join(__dirname, 'data/devProfiles.json');
    
    // Create data directory if it doesn't exist
    await fs.mkdir(path.dirname(profilesFile), { recursive: true });
    
    // Create default profiles file if missing
    if (!fs.existsSync(profilesFile)) {
      const defaultProfiles = [/* default profile objects */];
      await fs.writeFile(profilesFile, JSON.stringify(defaultProfiles, null, 2));
    }
    
    // Read and return active profiles
    const data = await fs.readFile(profilesFile, 'utf8');
    const profiles = JSON.parse(data);
    const activeProfiles = profiles.filter(p => p.isActive);
    
    res.json(activeProfiles);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching profiles:', error);
    res.json([]); // Return empty array on error
  }
});
```

#### **8.7 Session Management**

**Storage Locations:**
- `localStorage.selectedProfile` - Profile ID (e.g., "product-manager")
- `localStorage.currentProfileData` - Full profile object (JSON string)
- `localStorage.authToken` - Authentication token (currently not used)
- `localStorage.user` - User object (currently not used)

**Session Persistence:**
- When the app loads, AuthContext checks localStorage for stored profile
- If found and valid, user is automatically "logged in"
- If not found, user is redirected to profile selection

**Logout Process:**
1. User clicks logout button
2. `logout()` function clears all localStorage items
3. State is reset (`user` and `token` set to `null`)
4. User is redirected to `/select-profile`

#### **8.8 Security Considerations**

⚠️ **Important Notes:**

1. **Development-Only:** This profile-based system is designed for development environments only. Production systems should implement:
   - True authentication with passwords or SSO (SAML, OAuth)
   - Token-based authentication (JWT)
   - Secure session management
   - Password hashing (bcrypt)
   - HTTPS enforcement

2. **No Password Protection:** Anyone with access to the application can select any profile. This is acceptable for internal development but NOT for production.

3. **For Production Deployment (Not Currently Implemented):**

   If this application needs to be deployed to production, the following security enhancements would be required:
   - Replace profile selection with traditional login form
   - Implement password hashing in User model
   - Add JWT token generation and verification
   - Add middleware to verify tokens on protected routes
   - Replace localStorage with secure HTTP-only cookies
   - Implement SSO (Single Sign-On) integration with corporate identity provider

### **9. Database Schema & Models**

The NPDI Portal uses MongoDB with Mongoose for object modeling. This section details all data models and their relationships.

#### **9.1 Database Overview**

**Database Name:** `npdi-portal` (or as configured in `.env`)

**Connection Configuration** (`server/config/database.js`):
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const connectDB = async () => {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI || 'mongodb://localhost:27017/npdi-portal', {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true
    });
    console.log('MongoDB connected successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('MongoDB connection error:', error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};
```

**Collections:**
1. `productticketes` - Product development tickets (main collection)
2. `users` - User profiles and authentication
3. `permissions` - Role-based permissions
4. `formconfigurations` - Dynamic form configuration
5. `systemsettings` - Application settings
6. `userpreferences` - User preferences

}
```

**Static Methods:**

1. **Get Privileges for a Role:**
```javascript
const privileges = await Permission.getPrivilegesForRole('PRODUCT_MANAGER');
// Returns: { tickets: { view: true, edit: true }, ... }
```

2. **Initialize Default Permissions:**
```javascript
await Permission.initializeDefaultPermissions();
// Sets up default permissions for all three roles
```

**Default Permission Matrix:**

    // testMethod: Normalizes test method names (e.g., 'hplc' -> 'HPLC')
    // defaultMethod: Maps test attributes to default methods (e.g., 'purity' -> 'HPLC')
  },
  entries: [{
    key: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      lowercase: true  // Always stored lowercase for case-insensitive matching
    },
    value: {
      type: String,
      required: true  // Properly formatted/capitalized version
    },
    category: String,  // e.g., 'chemical', 'biological', 'physical', 'thermal'

  - `testMethod`: 126 default entries (chromatography, spectroscopy, mass spec, microbiological, biological)
  - `defaultMethod`: 90 default mappings (test → method assignments)

- **Version Tracking:** Automatic cache invalidation when admins update entries
- **Custom Tracking:** Separates user-added entries from seeded defaults
- **Category Organization:** Groups entries by type for easier management

**Indexes:**
- `configType`: Fast lookup by configuration type
- `entries.key`: Fast entry searches
- `entries.category`: Category-based filtering

**Static Methods:**
- `getConfigByType(configType)`: Get configuration by type
- `getAllConfigs()`: Get all three configuration types

**Instance Methods:**
- `upsertEntry(key, value, category, description, isCustom)`: Add or update entry
- `removeEntry(key)`: Delete entry by key
- `bulkImport(entries, replaceAll)`: Bulk import entries

**Usage:**
```javascript
// Get test attribute configuration
const config = await ParserConfiguration.getConfigByType('testAttribute');

// Add custom entry
config.upsertEntry('viscosity', 'Viscosity', 'physical', 'Kinematic viscosity', true);
await config.save();

// Search for entries
const entries = config.entries.filter(e => e.category === 'biological');
```

**Seeded Data (303 total entries):**
- Test Attributes: purity, assay, pH, viscosity, density, sterility, endotoxin, potency, etc.
- Test Methods: HPLC, GC, NMR, FTIR, LAL, PCR, ELISA, Flow Cytometry, etc.
- Default Mappings: purity→HPLC, endotoxin→LAL, cell viability→Flow Cytometry, etc.

**Admin UI Access:** Admin Dashboard → System Settings → Quality Tests

#### **9.10 WeightMatrix Model**

**Location:** `server/models/WeightMatrix.js`

Stores gross weight mappings for package sizes (SAP MARA fields: BRGEW, GEWEI).

```javascript
{
  size: String (unique, e.g., "100G", "1L", "500MG"),

### **11. Form System**

The NPDI Portal features a sophisticated dynamic form system where form configurations are stored in MongoDB and rendered dynamically.

#### **11.1 Form System Overview**

The form system consists of two main components:
1. **Form Configuration** - Database-stored definition of all form sections and fields (managed via seed scripts)
2. **DynamicFormSection Component** - React component that renders forms based on configuration

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Conditional field visibility based on other field values
- ✅ Support for multiple field types (text, number, select, date, radio, checkbox, etc.)
- ✅ Field validation rules (min, max, pattern, required)
- ✅ Default values and dropdown options
- ✅ Centralized form configuration stored in MongoDB

**Note:** Form configurations are managed via seed scripts (`server/scripts/seedFormConfig.js`) rather than through a UI editor. This ensures configurations are version-controlled and deployed consistently across environments.

#### **11.2 Form Configuration Structure**

**Storage:** MongoDB `formconfigurations` collection
**Model:** `server/models/FormConfiguration.js`

**Configuration Schema:**
```javascript
{
  version: '1.0',
  sections: [
    {
      id: 'basic-info',              // Unique section identifier
      title: 'Basic Information',     // Display title
      description: 'Product overview', // Optional description
      order: 1,                       // Display order
      visible: true,                  // Section visibility
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'productName',          // Field identifier
          label: 'Product Name',        // Display label
          type: 'text',                 // Field type
          required: true,               // Is field required?
          editable: true,               // Can users edit?
          visible: true,                // Is field visible?
          defaultValue: '',             // Default value
          placeholder: 'Enter product name',
          
          // For select/radio fields
          options: ['Option 1', 'Option 2'],
          
          // Conditional visibility
          visibleWhen: {
            fieldKey: 'productType',
            value: 'Chemical'
          },
          
          // Validation rules
          validation: {
            min: 0,
            max: 100,
            pattern: '^[A-Z0-9]+$',
            message: 'Custom error message'
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

#### **11.3 Supported Field Types**

| Type | Description | Example Usage |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `text` | Single-line text input | Product name, CAS number |
| `textarea` | Multi-line text input | Description, notes |
| `number` | Numeric input | Molecular weight, purity |
| `email` | Email address | Contact email |
| `date` | Date picker | Expected launch date |
| `select` | Dropdown menu | Product type, SBU |
| `radio` | Radio button group | Production type (In-House/Third Party) |
| `checkbox` | Single checkbox | Requires SDS, Is active |
| `file` | File upload | Attachment, SDS document |
| `color` | Color picker | Status colors |
| `url` | URL input | Website link |
| `tel` | Phone number | Contact phone |

#### **11.4 Conditional Field Visibility**

Fields can be shown or hidden based on the values of other fields using the `visibleWhen` property.

**Example 1: Show field when another field has specific value**
```javascript
{
  name: 'thirdPartySupplier',
  label: 'Third Party Supplier Name',
  type: 'text',
  visibleWhen: {
    fieldKey: 'productionType',    // Dependent field
    value: 'Third Party'           // Required value
  }
}
```
→ Shows "Third Party Supplier Name" only when "Production Type" is "Third Party"

**Example 2: Show field when another field matches one of several values**
```javascript
{
  name: 'chemicalFormula',
  label: 'Molecular Formula',
  type: 'text',
  visibleWhen: {
    fieldKey: 'productType',
    values: ['Chemical', 'Reagent', 'Buffer']  // Multiple values (OR condition)
  }
}
```
→ Shows "Molecular Formula" when product type is Chemical, Reagent, OR Buffer

**Example 3: Show field when checkbox is checked**
```javascript
{
  name: 'sdsVersion',
  label: 'SDS Version',
  type: 'text',
  visibleWhen: {
    fieldKey: 'requiresSDS',
    value: true  // Boolean value
  }
}
```

#### **11.5 DynamicFormSection Component**

**Location:** `client/src/components/forms/DynamicFormSection.jsx`

This component renders form sections dynamically based on configuration.

**Usage:**
```javascript
import DynamicFormSection from './components/forms/DynamicFormSection';

function CreateTicket() {
  const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors }, watch, setValue } = useForm();
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      {formConfig.sections.map(section => (
        <DynamicFormSection
          key={section.id}
          section={section}
          register={register}
          errors={errors}
          watch={watch}
          setValue={setValue}
          readOnly={false}
          data={formData}
        />
      ))}
    </form>
  );
}
```

**Props:**
- `section` - Section configuration object
- `register` - React Hook Form register function
- `errors` - Form validation errors
- `watch` - Watch function to monitor field values
- `setValue` - Function to programmatically set field values
- `readOnly` - Whether form is in read-only mode
- `data` - Current form data
- `previewMode` - Show all fields regardless of visibility conditions (for preview)
- `sapImportedFields` - Set of fields imported from SAP (for highlighting)
- `getSAPImportedClass` - Function to get CSS class for SAP-imported fields
- `sapMetadata` - Metadata from SAP import
- `onOpenSimilarProducts` - Handler for similar products search
- `onFieldEdit` - Handler when SAP-imported field is edited

**Field Rendering Logic:**
1. Check if field is visible (based on `visible` property and `visibleWhen` conditions)
2. Check if field is editable (based on `editable` property and `readOnly` prop)
3. Render appropriate input component based on field `type`
4. Apply validation rules from field configuration
5. Show error messages from form validation
6. Apply SAP import highlighting if applicable

#### **11.6 Modifying Form Configuration**

**Note:** Form configurations are managed through seed scripts for version control and consistency across environments.

**To modify form configuration:**

**1. Edit the Seed Script:**
```bash
cd server/scripts
nano seedFormConfig.js
```

**2. Modify the Configuration:**
The seed script contains the form configuration as a JavaScript object. Make your changes:
- Add/remove/modify sections
- Add/remove/modify fields
- Update field properties (required, visible, editable, etc.)
- Set validation rules
- Configure conditional visibility

**3. Run the Seed Script:**
```bash
# From the server/scripts directory
node seedFormConfig.js
```

**4. Verify Changes:**
- Restart the application
- Navigate to create/edit ticket
- Verify your form changes appear correctly

**Advantages of Script-Based Configuration:**
- ✅ Version controlled in Git
- ✅ Consistent across development, staging, and production
- ✅ Easy to review changes in pull requests
- ✅ Can be deployed automatically with code
- ✅ No risk of accidental UI-based changes in production

**Example - Adding a New Field:**
```javascript
{
  fieldKey: 'expirationDate',
  label: 'Expiration Date',
  type: 'date',
  required: false,
  visible: true,
  editable: true,
  helpText: 'Product expiration date'
}
```

**For future discriminator pattern:** When implementing multiple ticket types (chemical, instrument, etc.), each type will have its own form configuration managed via seed scripts.

#### **11.7 Field Validation**

Validation is handled at three levels:

**1. Client-Side Validation (React Hook Form):**
```javascript
register('productName', {
  required: field.required ? 'This field is required' : false,
  minLength: field.validation?.min ? {
    value: field.validation.min,
    message: `Minimum ${field.validation.min} characters`
  } : undefined,
  pattern: field.validation?.pattern ? {
    value: new RegExp(field.validation.pattern),
    message: field.validation.message || 'Invalid format'
  } : undefined
})
```

**2. Schema Validation (Mongoose):**
Defined in model schemas (e.g., `ProductTicket.js`)

**3. Backend Validation (Express Routes):**
Custom validation in route handlers

**Common Validation Rules:**
- `required` - Field must have a value
- `min` / `max` - Min/max length for strings, min/max value for numbers
- `pattern` - Regular expression pattern matching
- `email` - Valid email format
- `url` - Valid URL format
- Custom validators - Business logic validation

#### **11.8 Pre-filled Forms from Palantir Integration for SAP Data**

The form system integrates with Palantir (for SAP MARA data) to auto-populate fields:

**SAP-Imported Field Features:**
- Green background highlight to indicate SAP data
- Metadata tooltip showing source and description
- Auto-remove highlight when user edits the field
- "Similar Products" button to search by CAS number

**SAP Import Flow:**
1. User enters CAS number or SKU
2. Click "Import from SAP" button
3. System queries Palantir MARA API
4. Returned data populates form fields
5. Imported fields show green highlight
6. User can accept SAP data or edit as needed
7. Highlight removes when field is edited

**Imported Fields (typical):**
- Product name / description
- Manufacturer
- Package size and unit
- Material group
- Storage conditions
- Hazard classification
- And more...

#### **11.9 Form Integration with PubChem**

Chemical property fields integrate with PubChem for auto-population:

**PubChem Integration Flow:**
1. User enters CAS number in Chemical Properties section
2. Click "Auto-fill from PubChem" button
3. System queries PubChem REST API
4. Chemical data is retrieved:
   - IUPAC name
   - Molecular formula
   - Molecular weight
   - Canonical SMILES
   - InChI / InChIKey
   - Synonyms
5. Fields are auto-populated
6. User can review and modify as needed

**Location:** `client/src/pages/CreateTicket.jsx` contains PubChem fetch logic

#### **11.10 Form State Management**

**Draft Auto-Save:**
Forms automatically save to draft status periodically to prevent data loss.

**localStorage Caching:**
Form data is cached in browser localStorage for recovery if browser crashes.

**Controlled vs Uncontrolled:**
The form system uses controlled components (React Hook Form) for:
- Better validation
- Easier state management
- Programmatic field updates
- Conditional logic

**Form Submission Flow:**
1. User fills out form
2. Client-side validation runs
3. If valid, data is sent to `/api/products` (POST)
4. Server validates data
5. Mongoose schema validation runs
6. Document is saved to MongoDB
7. Response returns created ticket
8. User is redirected to ticket detail page

### **12. Ticket Workflow**

This section describes the lifecycle of a product ticket from creation to completion.

#### **12.1 Ticket Statuses**

Tickets progress through six distinct statuses:

| Status | Description | Who Can Set | Next Steps |
|--------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **DRAFT** | Initial creation, incomplete | System (auto) | User submits when ready |
| **SUBMITTED** | Submitted for review | Product Manager | PM Ops reviews and processes |
| **IN_PROCESS** | Being worked on by PM Ops | PM Ops, Admin | Continue processing, gather info |
| **NPDI_INITIATED** | Formal NPDI process started | PM Ops, Admin | Complete NPDI requirements |
| **COMPLETED** | Fully processed and finished | PM Ops, Admin | Archive, no further action |
| **CANCELED** | Canceled/abandoned | Any role | Archive, document reason |

**Status Flow Diagram:**
```
DRAFT
  │
  │ (Submit button clicked)
  ▼
SUBMITTED
  │
  │ (PM Ops begins processing)
  ▼
IN_PROCESS
  │
  │ (Formal NPDI kickoff)
  ▼
NPDI_INITIATED
  │
  │ (All requirements met)
  ▼
COMPLETED

(Any status can transition to CANCELED)
```

#### **12.2 Priority Levels**

Each ticket has a priority that affects its processing order:

| Priority | Description | SLA Target | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **LOW** | No rush, background work | 30+ days | Low priority products, research |
| **MEDIUM** | Normal priority | 14-30 days | Standard new products |
| **HIGH** | Important, expedited | 7-14 days | Important launches |
| **URGENT** | Critical, immediate attention | 1-7 days | Customer commitments, urgent needs |

**Priority Settings:**
- Product Managers can set priority when creating ticket
- PM Ops and Admins can change priority later
- Priority is visible on dashboard and ticket list
- Urgent tickets show red indicator

#### **12.3 Ticket Creation Flow**

- Created by
- Created date
- SBU
- Product type
- CAS number
- SKU numbers
- And more...

#### **12.10 Template-Based Viewing System**

The NPDI Portal implements a template-based viewing system that enables different ticket types to have customized data views. This infrastructure prepares the system for supporting multiple business units (chemicals, biologics, instruments, etc.) with different data requirements.

**How Template-Based Viewing Works:**

1. **Template Assignment**
   - Each user is assigned a ticket template in the Admin Dashboard → User Management
   - Available templates: Default, Biologics, Instruments (future), etc.
   - Template determines which form configuration is used for ticket creation

2. **Ticket Creation with Template**
   - When a user creates a ticket, their assigned template is automatically applied
   - The ticket stores a reference to the template (`template` field)
   - Form fields are rendered based on the template's form configuration

3. **Template-Based Viewing for Closed Tickets**
   - **Active tickets** (DRAFT, SUBMITTED, IN_PROCESS, NPDI_INITIATED) use the standard PMOpsTabView
   - **Closed tickets** (COMPLETED, CANCELED) use DynamicTicketView if they have a template
   - DynamicTicketView renders ticket data based on the template's form configuration

4. **DynamicTicketView Component**
   - Location: `client/src/components/DynamicTicketView.jsx`
   - Creates tabbed interface from template sections
   - Displays only visible fields defined in the template
   - Handles nested data (e.g., `chemicalProperties.casNumber`)
   - Formats values appropriately (booleans, objects, arrays)
   - Shows template name in footer

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Different ticket types can have different viewing layouts
- ✅ Closed tickets render with template-specific field organization
- ✅ Active tickets preserve existing editing functionality
- ✅ Infrastructure ready for discriminator pattern implementation
- ✅ Future-ready for multiple business units and ticket types

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Chemical Product (Default Template)**
- Uses standard chemical properties view
- Shows CAS number, molecular formula, hazard classification
- Displays quality specifications and regulatory information

**Scenario 2: Biologics Product (Biologics Template)**
- Uses biologics-specific view
- Shows biological properties, expression systems, storage conditions
- Displays lot control and stability data

**Scenario 3: Instrument Product (Future Instruments Template)**
- Will use instrument-specific view
- Will show model numbers, calibration data, warranty information
- Will display technical specifications and maintenance requirements

**Database Schema:**

```javascript
// ProductTicket model
{
  ticketNumber: "NPDI-2025-0050",
  productName: "Product Name",
  status: "COMPLETED",
  template: ObjectId("..."),  // ← Reference to TicketTemplate
  // ... other fields
}

// TicketTemplate model
{
  name: "Biologics",
  description: "Template for biological products",
  formConfiguration: ObjectId("..."),  // ← Reference to FormConfiguration
  isActive: true
}

// FormConfiguration model
{
  sections: [
    {
      sectionKey: "basic",
      name: "Basic Information",
      order: 1,
      visible: true,
      fields: [
        { fieldKey: "productName", label: "Product Name", type: "text", visible: true },
        // ... more fields
      ]
    },
    // ... more sections
  ]
}
```

**API Flow:**

```javascript
// Backend: Populate template when fetching ticket
const ticket = await ProductTicket.findById(ticketId)
  .populate({
    path: 'template',
    populate: { path: 'formConfiguration' }
  });

// Response includes template and formConfiguration
{
  ticketNumber: "NPDI-2025-0050",
  template: {
    name: "Biologics",
    formConfiguration: {
      sections: [...]
    }
  }
}
```

**Frontend Conditional Rendering:**

```jsx
// TicketDetails.jsx
{ticket.status === 'COMPLETED' || ticket.status === 'CANCELED' ? (
  ticket.template ? (
    // Template-based view for closed tickets
    <DynamicTicketView ticket={ticket} template={ticket.template} />
  ) : (
    // Fallback for old tickets without templates
    <PMOpsTabView ticket={ticket} onTicketUpdate={fetchTicket} />
  )
) : (
  // Standard editing view for active tickets
  <PMOpsTabView ticket={ticket} onTicketUpdate={fetchTicket} />
)}
```

**Future Enhancements:**

This template infrastructure prepares for the discriminator pattern refactoring:
- Different ticket **types** (chemical, biologics, instruments) can have specialized schemas
- Each type can have different required fields and validation rules
- UI automatically adapts to each ticket type's data structure
- External API can return type-specific data without null fields

See `docs/DISCRIMINATOR_PATTERN_REFACTORING_PLAN.md` for more details on the planned evolution.

The NPDI Portal integrates with external systems to auto-populate data and enhance functionality.

#### **15.1 Integration Overview**

**Integrated Systems:**
1. **PubChem** - Chemical compound database
2. **SAP / Palantir MARA** - Product master data
3. **Similar Products Search** - CAS-based product lookup

**Integration Architecture:**
```
NPDI Portal
     │
     ├── PubChem REST API (chemicals)
     │   └── https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rest/pug
     │
     └── Palantir MARA API (SAP data)
         └── https://[palantir-url]/api/mara
```

#### **15.2 PubChem Integration**

**Purpose:** Auto-populate chemical properties from PubChem database

**PubChem Resources:**
- Compound database with 100M+ chemicals
- Free REST API
- Data includes: names, formulas, properties, synonyms, structure data

**How It Works:**

1. **User enters CAS number** in Chemical Properties section
2. **User clicks "Auto-fill from PubChem"** button
3. **System queries PubChem API** with CAS number
4. **PubChem returns compound data**
5. **Form fields auto-populate** with retrieved data
6. **Green highlight** indicates auto-filled fields
7. **User can edit** any auto-filled field (highlight removes)

**PubChem API Endpoints Used:**

**1. Get Compound by CAS:**
```http
GET https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rest/pug/compound/name/{casNumber}/JSON

Example: GET .../compound/name/50-81-7/JSON
Returns: Compound data for Ascorbic Acid
```

**2. Get Compound Properties:**
```http
GET https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rest/pug/compound/cid/{cid}/property/MolecularFormula,MolecularWeight,IUPACName/JSON
```

**Data Fetched from PubChem:**
- **CID** (PubChem Compound ID)
- **IUPAC Name** (systematic chemical name)
- **Molecular Formula** (e.g., C6H8O6)
- **Molecular Weight** (g/mol)
- **Canonical SMILES** (structure representation) - *Used for molecular structure visualization*
- **InChI** (International Chemical Identifier)
- **InChIKey** (hashed InChI for searching)
- **Synonyms** (alternative names)
- **Compound Description**
- **Additional Properties:**
  - Melting point
  - Boiling point
  - Flash point
  - Density
  - LogP (partition coefficient)
  - Polar surface area
  - H-bond donors/acceptors
  - Rotatable bonds
  - Exact mass
  - Complexity

#### **15.3 Molecular Structure Viewer**

**Purpose:** Professional 2D molecular structure visualization using RDKit-JS

**Key Features:**
- **Client-side rendering** - All processing happens in the browser for privacy
- **ACS 1996 skeletal formula standards** - Professional chemical drawing conventions
- **Proper zigzag patterns** - Correct sp3 carbon chain geometry (e.g., butanol, pseudoephedrine)
- **Interactive rotation controls** - Adjust molecule orientation with ±5° buttons or direct input
- **Monochrome output** - Clean black-on-white structures for clarity

**How It Works:**

1. **User enters SMILES** string in Chemical Properties form (manually or via PubChem auto-population)
2. **Structure appears automatically** in the right column of the form
3. **RDKit-JS generates 2D coordinates** using coordgen algorithm for optimal geometry
4. **Rendering pipeline:**
   - Cyclic molecules: Uses `straighten_depiction()` + `normalize_depiction()` for clean ring alignment
   - Linear molecules: Uses `normalize_depiction()` for horizontal main axis
   - Applies rotation transformation if specified
5. **User can rotate** the structure using controls in the viewer header
   - Click **−** button to rotate counter-clockwise by 5°
   - Click **+** button to rotate clockwise by 5°
   - Enter exact degree value in the input field
   - Rotation resets to 0° when SMILES changes

**Technical Implementation:**

**Component:** `client/src/components/MoleculeViewerRDKit.jsx`

```javascript
// RDKit-JS loads from CDN (unpkg.com/@rdkit/rdkit)
// Initializes WebAssembly module on component mount
const RDKit = await window.initRDKitModule();

// For each SMILES string:
const mol = rdkit.get_mol(smiles);

// Generate optimal 2D coordinates (cyclic molecules only)
if (numRings > 0) {
  mol.set_new_coords(true); // Use coordgen
}

// Apply alignment
mol.straighten_depiction();  // Bonds at 30° multiples
mol.normalize_depiction(1);  // Horizontal main axis

// Generate SVG with rotation
let svg = mol.get_svg_with_highlights(JSON.stringify({
  width: 300,
  height: 250,
  rotate: rotationAngle,  // User-controlled
  fixedBondLength: 30,    // ACS standard
  backgroundColour: [1, 1, 1],  // White
  symbolColour: [0, 0, 0]        // Black
}));
```

**Form Integration:** `client/src/components/forms/ChemicalPropertiesForm.jsx`

The molecular structure viewer appears in the Chemical Properties section when a valid SMILES string is present. Layout:
- **Left column:** SMILES, InChI, InChI Key, Physical State, Shipping Conditions
- **Right column:** Molecular Structure viewer with rotation controls

**Rotation Controls:**
```jsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-2">
  <button onClick={() => setRotation(prev => prev - 5)}>−</button>
  <input
    type="number"
    value={rotation}
    onChange={(e) => setRotation(parseInt(e.target.value))}
  />
  <span>°</span>
  <button onClick={() => setRotation(prev => prev + 5)}>+</button>
</div>
```

**Privacy & Security:**
- No external API calls for structure rendering
- All processing in browser via WebAssembly
- SMILES data never leaves the client
- CDN-loaded library (cached after first load)

**Supported SMILES Features:**
- Linear and cyclic molecules
- Aromatic rings (benzene, etc.)
- Heteroatoms (N, O, S, P, etc.)
- Stereochemistry (wedge/dash bonds)
- Complex polycyclic structures

**Example Molecules:**
- Ethanol: `CCO`
- Butanol: `CCCCO`
- Benzene: `c1ccccc1`
- Diphenhydramine: `CN(C)CCOC(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`
- Pseudoephedrine: `CC(C(c1ccccc1)O)NC`

**Implementation:**

**Frontend (`ChemicalPropertiesForm.jsx`):**
```javascript
const handlePubChemLookup = async () => {
  if (!casNumber) {
    toast.error('Please enter a CAS number');
    return;
  }

  setCasLookupLoading(true);
  try {
    // Call PubChem API via backend proxy
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rest/pug/compound/name/${casNumber}/JSON`
    );
    const data = await response.json();

    // Extract compound data
    const compound = data.PC_Compounds[0];
    const properties = compound.props;

    // Auto-fill form fields
    setValue('chemicalProperties.molecularFormula', 
      properties.find(p => p.urn.label === 'Molecular Formula')?.value.sval
    );
    setValue('chemicalProperties.molecularWeight',
      properties.find(p => p.urn.label === 'Molecular Weight')?.value.fval
    );
    setValue('chemicalProperties.iupacName',
      properties.find(p => p.urn.label === 'IUPAC Name')?.value.sval
    );

    setAutoPopulated(true);  // Show green highlights
    toast.success('Chemical properties loaded from PubChem');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('PubChem lookup failed:', error);
    toast.error('Could not fetch data from PubChem');
  } finally {
    setCasLookupLoading(false);
  }
};
```

### **17. SKU and Pricing Management**

SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) management and pricing calculation are critical features for product development.

#### **17.1 SKU Management Overview**

**What is a SKU?**
- Unique identifier for a specific product configuration
- Includes package size, unit, and variant type
- Examples: "A1234-100G", "S5678-5ML", "L9012-1KG"

**SKU Variants:**
Each product ticket can have multiple SKU variants representing different package sizes or configurations.

**Variant Types:**
- **BULK** - Large quantity, basic packaging (e.g., 25kg drum)
- **CONF** - Configured/custom packaging
- **SPEC** - Special specification variant
- **VAR** - Standard variant (most common)
- **PREPACK** - Pre-packaged ready-to-ship

#### **17.2 SKU Variant Schema**

**Fields:**
```javascript
{
  type: 'VAR',  // BULK, CONF, SPEC, VAR, PREPACK
  sku: 'A1234-100G',  // Assigned SKU number
  description: 'Ascorbic Acid 99% - 100g bottle',
  
  packageSize: {
    value: 100,
    unit: 'g'
  },
  
  grossWeight: { value: 120, unit: 'g' },
  netWeight: { value: 100, unit: 'g' },
  volume: { value: 150, unit: 'mL' },
  
  pricing: {
    standardCost: 15.00,
    calculatedCost: 15.50,
    margin: 50,  // 50%
    calculatedMarginPercent: 48.5,
    limitPrice: 30.00,
    listPrice: 35.00,
    currency: 'USD'
  },
  
  inventory: {
    minimumStock: 100,
    leadTime: 14,  // days
    supplier: 'Internal'
  },
  
  forecastedSalesVolume: {
    year1: 500,
    year2: 750,
    year3: 1000
  }
}
```

#### **17.3 Creating SKU Variants**

**In Create Ticket Form:**

1. Navigate to "SKU Variants" section
2. Click "Add SKU Variant" button
3. Fill in variant details:
   - Select variant type
   - Enter package size and unit
   - Optionally enter SKU number (or leave for PM Ops to assign)
   - Enter description
4. Click "Add" to save variant
5. Repeat for additional variants

**Variant Form:**
```javascript
<div className="sku-variant-form">
  <select {...register(`skuVariants.${index}.type`)}>
    <option value="BULK">BULK</option>
    <option value="VAR">VAR</option>
    <option value="SPEC">SPEC</option>
    <option value="CONF">CONF</option>
    <option value="PREPACK">PREPACK</option>
  </select>

  <input 
    type="number" 
    placeholder="Package Size"
    {...register(`skuVariants.${index}.packageSize.value`)}
  />
  
  <select {...register(`skuVariants.${index}.packageSize.unit`)}>
    <option value="mg">mg</option>
    <option value="g">g</option>
    <option value="kg">kg</option>
    <option value="mL">mL</option>
    <option value="L">L</option>
  </select>
</div>
```

#### **17.4 SKU Assignment (PM Ops)**

**PM Ops Workflow:**

Once a ticket is submitted, PM Ops team assigns actual SKU numbers:

1. Open ticket in PM Ops dashboard
2. Navigate to "SKU Assignment" section (PM_OPS/ADMIN only)
3. Review requested variants
4. Assign SKU numbers:
   - Auto-generate from SKU number sequence
   - Or manually enter SKU from existing system
5. Verify variant details
6. Save assignments

**SKU Number Generation:**
```javascript
const generateSKUNumber = (variant, productInfo) => {
  // Format: [PREFIX]-[PRODUCT_CODE]-[SIZE][UNIT]
  // Example: MS-CHEM-100G, MS-KIT-5ML, MS-INST-EA

  const prefix = 'MS';  // MilliporeSigma
  const productCode = generateProductCode(productInfo);
  const size = variant.packageSize.value;
  const unit = variant.packageSize.unit.toUpperCase();

  return `${prefix}-${productCode}-${size}${unit}`;
};
```

**SKU Validation:**
- Check for duplicates in system
- Verify SKU format follows company standards
- Ensure SKU not already assigned to different product

#### **17.5 Pricing Calculations**

**Pricing Fields:**
- **Standard Cost** - Base cost to manufacture/acquire product
- **Calculated Cost** - Standard cost + overhead, packaging, etc.
- **Margin** - Target profit margin percentage (default: 50%)
- **Calculated Margin Percent** - Actual margin based on list price
- **Limit Price** - Minimum price (floor price)
- **List Price** - Suggested retail/catalog price

**Pricing Formulas:**

**Calculate Cost:**
```javascript
// Cost = standardCostPerUnit × packageSizeInBaseUnit
calculatedCost = standardCostPerUnit * packageSizeInBaseUnit
```

**Calculate List Price from Margin:**
```javascript
listPrice = calculatedCost / (1 - (margin / 100))

// Example: Cost = $15, Margin = 50%
// listPrice = 15 / (1 - 0.5) = 15 / 0.5 = $30
```

**Calculate Actual Margin:**
```javascript
calculatedMarginPercent = ((listPrice - calculatedCost) / listPrice) * 100

// Example: List = $35, Cost = $15
// margin = ((35 - 15) / 35) * 100 = 57.14%
```

**Pricing Component:**
```javascript
const calculatePricing = (costPerUnit, packageSize, margin) => {
  const calculatedCost = costPerUnit * packageSize;
  const listPrice = calculatedCost / (1 - (margin / 100));

  return {
    calculatedCost: calculatedCost.toFixed(2),
    listPrice: listPrice.toFixed(2)
  };
};

// Usage
const { calculatedCost, listPrice } = calculatePricing(0.50, 100, 65);
setValue('skuVariants.0.pricing.calculatedCost', calculatedCost);
setValue('skuVariants.0.pricing.listPrice', listPrice);
```

**Auto-Calculate on Change:**
```javascript
// Watch standard cost and margin fields
const standardCost = watch('skuVariants.0.pricing.standardCost');
const margin = watch('skuVariants.0.pricing.margin');

useEffect(() => {
  if (standardCost && margin) {
    const prices = calculatePricing(standardCost, margin);
    setValue('skuVariants.0.pricing.calculatedCost', prices.calculatedCost);
    setValue('skuVariants.0.pricing.listPrice', prices.listPrice);
    setValue('skuVariants.0.pricing.limitPrice', prices.limitPrice);
  }
}, [standardCost, margin]);
```

#### **17.6 Weight Matrix**

**Purpose:** Calculate package weights based on fill amount and container type

**Weight Matrix Model:**
```javascript
{
  packageType: 'Bottle',  // Bottle, Vial, Drum, Bag, etc.
  material: 'Glass',      // Glass, Plastic, Metal
  sizes: [
    {
      capacity: { value: 100, unit: 'mL' },
      tareWeight: { value: 50, unit: 'g' },  // Empty container weight
      maxFillWeight: { value: 120, unit: 'g' }
    },
    {
      capacity: { value: 500, unit: 'mL' },
      tareWeight: { value: 150, unit: 'g' },
      maxFillWeight: { value: 600, unit: 'g' }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Calculating Package Weights:**
```javascript
const calculatePackageWeight = (fillAmount, fillUnit, containerType, containerSize) => {
  // Find matching container in weight matrix
  const container = weightMatrix
    .find(wm => wm.packageType === containerType)
    ?.sizes.find(s => s.capacity.value === containerSize);

  if (!container) {
    return null;  // No match found
  }

  // Gross weight = fill amount + tare weight
  const grossWeight = fillAmount + container.tareWeight.value;

  return {
    netWeight: { value: fillAmount, unit: fillUnit },
    grossWeight: { value: grossWeight, unit: 'g' },
    tareWeight: container.tareWeight
  };
};

// Usage
const weights = calculatePackageWeight(100, 'g', 'Bottle', 100);
// Returns: { netWeight: 100g, grossWeight: 150g, tareWeight: 50g }
```

**Weight Matrix Management:**

**Location:** Admin Dashboard → Weight Matrix Management

**Features:**
- Add new container types
- Define tare weights for each size
- Update existing weights
- Import from Excel
- Export to Excel

#### **17.7 Sales Forecasting**

**Forecasted Sales Volume** helps with inventory planning and production scheduling.

**Fields:**
- Year 1 forecast (units)
- Year 2 forecast (units)
- Year 3 forecast (units)

**Forecasting Methods:**
1. **Historical Data** - Based on similar products
2. **Market Analysis** - Industry trends and market size
3. **Customer Commitments** - Pre-orders and agreements
4. **Expert Estimates** - PM judgment

**Forecast Display:**
```javascript
<div className="forecast-section">
  <h3>Sales Forecast</h3>
  <div className="forecast-inputs">
    <div>
      <label>Year 1</label>
      <input type="number" {...register('forecastedSalesVolume.year1')} />
      <span>units</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <label>Year 2</label>
      <input type="number" {...register('forecastedSalesVolume.year2')} />
      <span>units</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <label>Year 3</label>
      <input type="number" {...register('forecastedSalesVolume.year3')} />
      <span>units</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Forecast Validation:**
- Year 2 forecast should generally be ≥ Year 1 (growth assumption)
- Year 3 forecast should generally be ≥ Year 2
- Warn if forecasts decrease significantly (may indicate data entry error)
- Flag unrealistic forecasts (e.g., 1 million units for specialty chemical)

#### **17.8 Permissions for SKU/Pricing**

| Role | View SKUs | Edit SKUs | Assign SKUs | View Pricing | Edit Pricing |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| PRODUCT_MANAGER | ✅ | ✅ Request only | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| PM_OPS | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| ADMIN | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Permission Enforcement:**
```javascript
const canEditPricing = user.role === 'PM_OPS' || user.role === 'ADMIN';

{canEditPricing ? (
  <input type="number" {...register('pricing.listPrice')} />
) : (
  <span className="read-only">${variant.pricing.listPrice}</span>
)}
```

   - Success message appears
   - User appears in user list

6. **Add User to Dev Profiles (Development Only)**
   
   If you're in development mode using profile-based auth:
   
   ```bash
   # Edit the dev profiles file
   cd ~/npdi-app/server
   nano data/devProfiles.json
   ```
   
   Add new profile:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "new-user-id",
     "firstName": "Jane",
     "lastName": "Doe",
     "email": "jane.doe@milliporesigma.com",
     "role": "PRODUCT_MANAGER",
     "sbu": "Life Science",
     "isActive": true,
     "createdAt": "2024-01-15T00:00:00.000Z"
   }
   ```
   
   Save and restart server:
   ```bash

cd /home/ckabes/npdi-app/server/scripts
ls -la seedFormConfig.js
```

#### **19.2 Edit the Configuration**

```bash
# Use your preferred editor
nano seedFormConfig.js
# or
code seedFormConfig.js
```

The configuration structure:
```javascript
const formConfig = {
  name: 'Product Ticket Form - Default',
  sections: [
    {
      sectionKey: 'basic',
      name: 'Basic Information',
      visible: true,
      fields: [
        {
          fieldKey: 'productName',
          label: 'Product Name',
          type: 'text',
          required: true,

};
```

#### **19.3 Common Modifications**

**Add a new field:**
```javascript
{
  fieldKey: 'expirationDate',
  label: 'Expiration Date',
  type: 'date',
  required: false,
  visible: true,
  editable: true,
  helpText: 'Product expiration date'
}
```

**Make a field required:**
```javascript
required: true  // Change from false to true
```

**Add conditional visibility:**
```javascript
visibleWhen: {
  fieldKey: 'productionType',
  value: 'Procured'
}
```

**Add validation:**
```javascript
validation: {
  min: 0,
  max: 100,
  pattern: '^[A-Z0-9]+$',
  message: 'Custom error message'
}
```

#### **19.4 Run the Seed Script**

```bash
cd /home/ckabes/npdi-app/server/scripts
node seedFormConfig.js

```

---

### **21. Database Maintenance**

**Task:** Routine database maintenance tasks

#### **21.1 Backing Up the Database**

**Method 1: mongodump (Recommended)**

```bash
# Create backup directory
mkdir -p ~/npdi-backups

# Dump entire database
mongodump --db npdi-portal --out ~/npdi-backups/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Output:
# ~/npdi-backups/backup-20240115-143000/
#   └── npdi-portal/
#       ├── productticketes.bson
#       ├── productticketes.metadata.json
#       ├── users.bson
#       ├── users.metadata.json
#       └── ...
```

**Method 2: Export to JSON**

```bash
# Export specific collection
mongoexport --db npdi-portal --collection productticketes --out ~/npdi-backups/tickets-$(date +%Y%m%d).json

# Export with query (e.g., only completed tickets)
mongoexport --db npdi-portal --collection productticketes \
  --query '{"status": "COMPLETED"}' \
  --out ~/npdi-backups/completed-tickets.json
```

**Automated Backup Script:**

Create `~/npdi-backups/backup.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

BACKUP_DIR=~/npdi-backups
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

# Create backup
mongodump --db npdi-portal --out "$BACKUP_DIR/backup-$DATE"

# Compress
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/backup-$DATE.tar.gz" "$BACKUP_DIR/backup-$DATE"
rm -rf "$BACKUP_DIR/backup-$DATE"

# Delete backups older than 30 days
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name "backup-*.tar.gz" -mtime +30 -delete

echo "Backup completed: backup-$DATE.tar.gz"
```

Make executable and run:
```bash
chmod +x ~/npdi-backups/backup.sh
~/npdi-backups/backup.sh
```

**Schedule Daily Backups (cron):**

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add line (runs daily at 2 AM):
0 2 * * * /home/ckabes/npdi-backups/backup.sh >> /home/ckabes/npdi-backups/backup.log 2>&1
```

#### **21.2 Restoring from Backup**

**Restore Entire Database:**

```bash
# Stop the server first
pkill -f "node.*server"

# Restore from mongodump
mongorestore --db npdi-portal ~/npdi-backups/backup-20240115-143000/npdi-portal

# Start server
cd ~/npdi-app/server && npm start
```

**Restore Specific Collection:**

```bash
# Restore just tickets collection
mongorestore --db npdi-portal --collection productticketes \
  ~/npdi-backups/backup-20240115-143000/npdi-portal/productticketes.bson
```

**Restore from JSON Export:**

```bash
mongoimport --db npdi-portal --collection productticketes \
  --file ~/npdi-backups/tickets-20240115.json
```

#### **21.3 Database Cleanup**

**Remove Old Drafts:**

```bash
# Connect to MongoDB
mongosh npdi-portal

# Find drafts older than 90 days
db.productticketes.find({
  status: 'DRAFT',
  createdAt: { $lt: new Date(Date.now() - 90*24*60*60*1000) }
}).count()

# Delete old drafts (BE CAREFUL!)
db.productticketes.deleteMany({
  status: 'DRAFT',
  createdAt: { $lt: new Date(Date.now() - 90*24*60*60*1000) }
})
```

**Remove Canceled Tickets:**

```bash
mongosh npdi-portal

# Archive canceled tickets (export first!)
mongoexport --db npdi-portal --collection productticketes \
  --query '{"status": "CANCELED"}' \
  --out ~/npdi-backups/canceled-tickets-archive.json

# Then delete
db.productticketes.deleteMany({ status: 'CANCELED' })
```

#### **21.4 Database Performance**

**Create Indexes:**

Indexes speed up queries. Check current indexes:

```bash
mongosh npdi-portal

db.productticketes.getIndexes()
```

Create useful indexes:

```javascript
// Index on ticket number (for quick lookups)
db.productticketes.createIndex({ ticketNumber: 1 })

// Index on status (for filtered queries)
db.productticketes.createIndex({ status: 1 })

// Index on createdBy (for "my tickets" queries)
db.productticketes.createIndex({ createdBy: 1 })

// Compound index on status + createdAt (for recent tickets by status)
db.productticketes.createIndex({ status: 1, createdAt: -1 })

// Index on CAS number (for chemical lookups)
db.productticketes.createIndex({ "chemicalProperties.casNumber": 1 })
```

**Check Database Size:**

```bash
mongosh npdi-portal --eval "db.stats(1024*1024)"

# Output shows size in MB
```

**Compact Database** (reclaim space):

```bash
mongosh npdi-portal

db.runCommand({ compact: 'productticketes' })
```

⚠️ **Warning:** Compact requires downtime. Run during maintenance window.

#### **21.5 Database Monitoring**

**Check Database Status:**

```bash
# Is MongoDB running?
sudo service mongodb status

# View MongoDB logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log

# Check connections
mongosh npdi-portal --eval "db.serverStatus().connections"
```

**Monitor Slow Queries:**

Enable profiling:
```javascript
mongosh npdi-portal

// Profile slow queries (>100ms)
db.setProfilingLevel(1, { slowms: 100 })

// View slow queries
db.system.profile.find().limit(10).sort({ ts: -1 }).pretty()

// Disable profiling
db.setProfilingLevel(0)
```

## PART 6: TROUBLESHOOTING & MAINTENANCE

This part helps you diagnose and fix common issues with the NPDI Portal.

---

### **23. Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **23.1 Application Won't Start**

**Symptom:** Server or client fails to start

**Possible Causes & Solutions:**

**1. Port Already in Use**

```bash
# Check what's using port 5000 (server)
lsof -i :5000

# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>

# Or use pkill
pkill -f "node.*server"

# Check port 5173 (client)
lsof -i :5173
pkill -f "vite"
```

**2. MongoDB Not Running**

```bash
# Check MongoDB status
sudo service mongodb status

# If not running, start it
sudo service mongodb start

# Enable auto-start on boot
sudo systemctl enable mongodb
```

**3. Missing Environment Variables**

```bash
# Check .env file exists
ls -la ~/npdi-app/server/.env

# If missing, copy from example
cd ~/npdi-app/server
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Edit with correct values
```

**4. Missing Dependencies**

```bash
# Reinstall all dependencies
cd ~/npdi-app/server
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

cd ~/npdi-app/client
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**5. Wrong Node Version**

```bash
# Check Node version
node --version
# Should be v18.x or v20.x

# If wrong version, use nvm
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

#### **23.2 "Cannot Connect to Database"**

**Symptom:** Error: "MongoNetworkError" or "ECONNREFUSED"

**Solutions:**

**1. Start MongoDB**
```bash
sudo service mongodb start
```

**2. Check MongoDB is listening**
```bash
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 27017
# Should show mongod listening on port 27017
```

**3. Verify connection string**
```bash
# In server/.env
cat ~/npdi-app/server/.env | grep MONGODB_URI

# Should be:
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/npdi-portal
```

**4. Check MongoDB logs**
```bash
sudo tail -50 /var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log
# Look for error messages
```

**5. Repair MongoDB (if corrupted)**
```bash
# Stop MongoDB
sudo service mongodb stop

# Repair
sudo mongod --repair --dbpath /var/lib/mongodb

# Start MongoDB
sudo service mongodb start
```

#### **23.3 "401 Unauthorized" or "403 Forbidden"**

**Symptom:** API requests fail with auth errors

**Solutions:**

**1. Profile not selected**
- Go to http://localhost:5173/select-profile
- Select a profile
- Try again

**2. Session expired**
- Log out (clear localStorage)
- Log back in
- Or in browser console:
  ```javascript
  localStorage.clear()
  location.reload()
  ```

**3. User not in database**
- Verify user exists in devProfiles.json
- Check user is active (isActive: true)

**4. Role doesn't have permission**
- Check permissions for that role
- Admin Dashboard → Permissions
- Grant necessary permissions

#### **23.4 Form Data Not Saving**

**Symptom:** Form submits but data doesn't appear in database

**Solutions:**

**1. Check browser console for errors**
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Look for red errors in Console tab
- Check Network tab for failed requests

**2. Check server logs**
```bash
# View server console output
# Look for error messages when form submits
```

**3. Validation errors**
- Required fields not filled
- Check for error messages in form
- Verify all red-highlighted fields have values

**4. Database write permissions**
```bash
# Check MongoDB can write
mongosh npdi-portal

db.productticketes.insert({ test: "test" })
# Should succeed

db.productticketes.deleteOne({ test: "test" })
```

**5. Schema validation**
- Data doesn't match schema requirements
- Check server logs for validation errors
- Review ProductTicket schema in models

#### **23.5 PubChem/Palantir Integration Not Working**

**Symptom:** "Auto-fill from PubChem" or Palantir SAP MARA import fails

**Solutions:**

**1. PubChem Issues:**

```bash
# Test PubChem API directly
curl "https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rest/pug/compound/name/50-81-7/JSON"

# If fails, check:
# - Internet connection
# - Firewall blocking PubChem
# - PubChem API is up (check pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov status)
```

**2. CORS Issues:**
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify server CORS configuration allows client URL
- In server/index.js, check cors() settings

**3. SAP/Palantir Issues:**
- Check Palantir URL in System Settings
- Verify API key is correct
- Test API endpoint:
  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
    https://palantir.example.com/api/mara/search
  ```

**4. Rate Limiting:**
- Too many requests to PubChem
- Wait a minute and try again
- Check System Settings → PubChem rate limit

#### **23.6 UI Not Updating / Stale Data**

**Symptom:** Changes made but UI shows old data

**Solutions:**

**1. Hard refresh browser**
```
Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows/Linux)
Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
```

**2. Clear browser cache**
- DevTools → Application tab → Clear storage
- Or browser settings → Clear cache

**3. React state not updating**
- Check if page needs manual refresh
- Click refresh button if available
- Navigate away and back

**4. Client build is cached**
```bash
# Rebuild client
cd ~/npdi-app/client
rm -rf dist
npm run build
npm run dev
```

**5. Server cache**
```bash
# Restart server to clear any caching
pkill -f "node.*server"
cd ~/npdi-app/server && npm start
```

#### **23.7 Export Fails / Download Not Working**

**Symptom:** Export button doesn't download file

**Solutions:**

**1. Check browser console**
- Look for JavaScript errors
- Check Network tab for failed API call

**2. Check server logs**
- Look for export errors
- May be Excel generation failure

**3. Large export timeout**
- Too many tickets to export at once
- Try smaller subset (filter by date range)
- Increase timeout in code

**4. File permissions**
- Server can't write temp file
- Check /tmp folder permissions:
  ```bash
  ls -la /tmp
  sudo chmod 1777 /tmp
  ```

**5. ExcelJS error**
- Corrupted data causing Excel generation to fail
- Check server logs for specific error
- Try exporting single ticket to isolate issue

---

### **24. Performance Optimization**

#### **24.1 Slow Page Load**

**Diagnose:**

1. **Check browser DevTools → Network tab**
   - Identify slow requests
   - Look for large file downloads
   - Check for failed requests causing retries

2. **Check server response times**
   - Use browser Network tab
   - Look for API calls taking >1 second

**Solutions:**

**1. Database Query Optimization**

```javascript
// Add indexes for commonly queried fields
mongosh npdi-portal

db.productticketes.createIndex({ status: 1, createdAt: -1 })
db.productticketes.createIndex({ createdBy: 1 })
db.productticketes.createIndex({ "chemicalProperties.casNumber": 1 })
```

**2. Pagination**

Ensure ticket list uses pagination:
```javascript
// In API call, use limit and skip
const params = {
  page: 1,
  limit: 50,  // Don't load more than 50 at once
  sortBy: 'createdAt',
  sortOrder: 'desc'
};
```

**3. Lazy Loading**

Only load data when needed:
```javascript
// Don't load all tickets on dashboard
// Load stats separately
// Load recent tickets separately (limit 5)
```

**4. Code Splitting**

Build client with code splitting:
```bash
cd ~/npdi-app/client
npm run build
# Vite automatically splits code
```

**5. Image Optimization**

If using images:
- Compress images
- Use appropriate formats (WebP for photos, SVG for icons)
- Lazy load images below fold

**6. Minimize Bundle Size**

```bash
# Analyze bundle
cd ~/npdi-app/client
npm run build -- --analyze

# Remove unused dependencies
npm prune
```

#### **24.2 Slow Form Submission**

**Solutions:**

**1. Reduce payload size**
- Don't send unnecessary fields
- Remove large arrays from submission if not changed

**2. Async processing**
- For large operations (e.g., PubChem lookup), use async
- Show loading spinner
- Don't block UI

**3. Database write optimization**
```javascript
// Use lean() for faster writes
const ticket = await ProductTicket.create(ticketData);

// Instead of:
const ticket = new ProductTicket(ticketData);
await ticket.save();
```

**4. Validation optimization**
- Move complex validation to background
- Do basic validation client-side
- Only validate changed fields

#### **24.3 High Memory Usage**

**Check memory usage:**

```bash
# Server memory
ps aux | grep node

# MongoDB memory
ps aux | grep mongod

# System memory
free -h
```

**Solutions:**

**1. Restart services**
```bash
# Restart server
pkill -f "node.*server"
cd ~/npdi-app/server && npm start

# Restart MongoDB
sudo service mongodb restart
```

**2. Limit MongoDB memory**

Edit `/etc/mongod.conf`:
```yaml
storage:
  wiredTiger:
    engineConfig:
      cacheSizeGB: 1  # Limit to 1GB
```

Restart MongoDB:
```bash
sudo service mongodb restart
```

**3. Node memory limit**

Start server with memory limit:
```bash
node --max-old-space-size=512 index.js
# Limits Node to 512MB
```

**4. Find memory leaks**

```bash
# Use Node inspector
node --inspect index.js

# Open chrome://inspect in Chrome
# Take heap snapshots to find leaks
```

---

### **25. Logs and Debugging**

#### **25.1 Server Logs**

**View logs:**

```bash
# If server running in terminal, logs appear there

# If using PM2:
pm2 logs npdi-app

# If using systemd:
sudo journalctl -u npdi-app -f

# Or output to file:
cd ~/npdi-app/server
npm start > server.log 2>&1
tail -f server.log
```

**Log levels:**

```javascript
// In server code
console.log('Info message');      // General info
console.warn('Warning message');  // Warnings
console.error('Error message');   // Errors
console.debug('Debug message');   // Debug (verbose)
```

**Enable debug logging:**

```bash
# In .env
DEBUG=*
# Or specific namespace:
DEBUG=express:*,mongodb:*
```

#### **25.2 MongoDB Logs**

**View logs:**

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log
```

**Enable query logging:**

```javascript
mongosh npdi-portal

// Enable profiling (logs slow queries)
db.setProfilingLevel(1, { slowms: 100 })

// View slow queries
db.system.profile.find().limit(10).sort({ ts: -1 }).pretty()

// Disable profiling
db.setProfilingLevel(0)
```

**Check for errors:**

```bash
sudo grep -i error /var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log
```

#### **25.3 Client Debugging**

**Browser Console:**

Open DevTools (F12):
- **Console tab:** JavaScript errors and logs
- **Network tab:** API calls and responses
- **Application tab:** localStorage, session storage
- **Sources tab:** Set breakpoints in code

**React DevTools:**

Install browser extension:
- Chrome: React Developer Tools
- View component tree
- Inspect props and state
- Profile performance

**Enable verbose logging:**

```javascript
// In client code, add console.logs
console.log('Form data:', formData);
console.log('API response:', response);
```

**Debug API calls:**

```javascript
// In api.js, log all requests/responses
apiClient.interceptors.request.use(request => {
  console.log('Request:', request);
  return request;
});

apiClient.interceptors.response.use(response => {
  console.log('Response:', response);
  return response;
});
```

#### **25.4 Network Debugging**

**Check API connectivity:**

```bash
# Test server endpoint from command line
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Should return:
# {"status":"OK","timestamp":"2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z","version":"1.0.0"}
```

**Test from client to server:**

```javascript
// In browser console
fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/profiles')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error)
```

**Check CORS:**

```javascript
// If CORS error, check server cors config
// In server/index.js:
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'http://localhost:5173',  // Should match client URL
  credentials: true
}));
```

**Proxy Issues:**

```javascript
// In client/vite.config.js
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'http://localhost:5000',
        changeOrigin: true
      }
    }
  }
});
```

---

### **26. Security Best Practices**

#### **26.1 Environment Variables**

**Never commit .env files:**

```bash
# Ensure .env is in .gitignore
echo ".env" >> .gitignore

# Check .env not in git
git status
# Should not show .env
```

**Secure sensitive values:**

```bash
# Generate strong secret
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"

# Use in .env
SESSION_SECRET=<generated_secret>
```

**Environment-specific configs:**

```bash
# Development: .env.development
# Production: .env.production
# Never mix environments
```

#### **26.2 Database Security**

**Enable authentication:**

```bash
# Create admin user
mongosh

use admin
db.createUser({
  user: "admin",
  pwd: "strong_password_here",
  roles: ["root"]
})

use npdi-portal
db.createUser({
  user: "npdi_user",
  pwd: "strong_password_here",
  roles: ["readWrite"]
})
```

**Enable auth in mongod.conf:**

```yaml
security:
  authorization: enabled
```

**Update connection string:**

```bash
# In .env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://npdi_user:strong_password_here@localhost:27017/npdi-portal
```

**Backup encryption:**

```bash
# Encrypt backup
tar -czf - backup/ | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -out backup.tar.gz.enc

# Decrypt backup
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in backup.tar.gz.enc | tar -xzf -
```

#### **26.3 Application Security**

**HTTPS in Production:**

Use nginx or Apache as reverse proxy with SSL:

```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name npdi.example.com;

  ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }
}
```

**Security Headers:**

Already configured in server/index.js with Helmet:

```javascript
app.use(helmet());
// Sets various HTTP headers for security
```

**Rate Limiting:**

Already configured:

```javascript
app.use('/api', rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,  // 15 minutes
  max: 100  // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
}));
```

**Input Validation:**

Always validate user input:

```javascript
// In models, use validators
email: {
  type: String,
  validate: {
    validator: function(v) {
      return /^\S+@\S+\.\S+$/.test(v);
    },
    message: 'Invalid email format'
  }
}
```

**SQL/NoSQL Injection Prevention:**

Mongoose handles this automatically with:
- Parameterized queries
- Schema validation
- Type casting

But still be careful with raw queries:

```javascript
// GOOD (Mongoose handles escaping)
ProductTicket.find({ status: userInput })

// BAD (raw query with user input)
db.collection.find({ $where: userInput })  // Never do this!
```

**XSS Prevention:**

React escapes by default, but be careful with:
- `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` - avoid when possible
- User-generated content - sanitize before rendering

```javascript
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

// Sanitize HTML before rendering
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ 
  __html: DOMPurify.sanitize(userContent) 
}} />
```

#### **26.4 Access Control**

**Verify permissions:**

Always check permissions server-side:

```javascript
// In route handler
const hasPermission = await checkUserPermission(userId, 'tickets', 'edit');
if (!hasPermission) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' });
}
```

**Audit logging:**

Log security-relevant events:

```javascript
console.log(`User ${userId} accessed ${resource} at ${new Date()}`);

// For production, use proper logging library
logger.info('User action', {
  userId,
  action: 'delete_ticket',
  ticketId,
  timestamp: new Date()
});
```

**Session management:**

```javascript
// Set session timeout
const SESSION_TIMEOUT = 60 * 60 * 1000;  // 1 hour

// Check session age
if (Date.now() - sessionStart > SESSION_TIMEOUT) {
  // Force logout
  logout();
}
```

### **28. Monitoring and Logging**

#### **28.1 Application Monitoring**

**PM2 Monitoring:**

```bash
# View running processes
pm2 list

# Monitor in real-time
pm2 monit

# View logs
pm2 logs npdi-app

# View specific app
pm2 show npdi-app
```

**PM2 Plus (Advanced Monitoring):**

```bash
# Link to PM2 Plus dashboard (optional, free tier available)
pm2 link <secret_key> <public_key>

# Features:
# - Real-time metrics
# - Error tracking
# - Custom metrics
# - Alerts
```

**System Monitoring with htop:**

```bash
sudo apt install htop
htop
# Monitor CPU, memory, processes
```

**Disk Space Monitoring:**

```bash
# Check disk usage
df -h

# Check large directories
du -h --max-depth=1 /var/www/npdi-app | sort -h

# Alert if disk >80% full
DISK_USAGE=$(df -h | grep '/$' | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//')
if [ "$DISK_USAGE" -gt 80 ]; then
  echo "WARNING: Disk usage is ${DISK_USAGE}%"
  # Send alert email
fi
```

#### **28.2 Database Monitoring**

**MongoDB Stats:**

```bash
# Connect to MongoDB
mongosh npdi-portal

# Database stats
db.stats()

# Collection stats
db.productticketes.stats()

# Current operations
db.currentOp()

# Server status
db.serverStatus()
```

**Slow Query Monitoring:**

```javascript
// Enable profiling
db.setProfilingLevel(1, { slowms: 100 })

// View slow queries
db.system.profile.find({ millis: { $gt: 100 } }).sort({ ts: -1 }).limit(10)

// Disable profiling
db.setProfilingLevel(0)
```

#### **28.3 Log Management**

**Centralized Logging:**

All logs in one place:

```bash
# Create log directory
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/npdi-app

# PM2 logs
pm2 logs --format --lines 100 > /var/log/npdi-app/pm2.log

# Nginx access log
tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log

# Nginx error log
tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

# MongoDB log
tail -f /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log
```

**Log Rotation:**

Configure logrotate for PM2 logs:

Create `/etc/logrotate.d/npdi-app`:

```
/var/log/npdi-app/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 14
    compress
    delaycompress
    notifempty
    missingok
    copytruncate
}
```

Test:
```bash
sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/npdi-app
```

**Structured Logging (Winston):**

For better production logging, use Winston:

```bash
cd /var/www/npdi-app/server
npm install winston
```

Configure in `server/utils/logger.js`:

```javascript
const winston = require('winston');

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info',
  format: winston.format.combine(
    winston.format.timestamp(),
    winston.format.json()
  ),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'error.log', level: 'error' }),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' }),
  ],
});

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  logger.add(new winston.transports.Console({
    format: winston.format.simple(),
  }));
}

module.exports = logger;
```

Usage:

```javascript
const logger = require('./utils/logger');

logger.info('User logged in', { userId: user.id });
logger.error('Database error', { error: error.message });
```

#### **28.4 Alerts and Notifications**

**Microsoft Teams Alerts:**

The application supports Teams notifications via webhooks. Configure in System Settings:

```javascript
// Send Teams notification
const teamsNotificationService = require('./services/teamsNotificationService');

// Usage - notify on status change
await teamsNotificationService.notifyStatusChange(
  ticket,
  oldStatus,
  newStatus,
  user
);

// Notify on ticket creation
await teamsNotificationService.notifyTicketCreated(ticket, creator);

// Notify on comment
await teamsNotificationService.notifyCommentAdded(ticket, comment, commenter);
```

**Health Check Endpoint:**

```javascript
// In server/index.js
app.get('/api/health', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Check database connection
    await mongoose.connection.db.admin().ping();
    
    res.json({
      status: 'OK',
      timestamp: new Date(),
      uptime: process.uptime(),
      mongodb: 'connected'
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(503).json({
      status: 'ERROR',
      error: error.message
    });
  }
});
```

**External Monitoring:**

Use services like:
- **UptimeRobot** - Monitor health endpoint
- **Pingdom** - Website uptime monitoring
- **New Relic** - Application performance monitoring
- **Sentry** - Error tracking

### **29. Backup and Recovery**

#### **29.1 Automated Backups**

**Daily Database Backup Script:**

Create `/home/deploy/backup-npdi.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Configuration
BACKUP_DIR=/home/deploy/npdi-backups
DB_NAME=npdi-portal
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
RETENTION_DAYS=30

# Create backup directory
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Dump database
mongodump --db "$DB_NAME" --out "$BACKUP_DIR/temp-$DATE"

# Compress
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/npdi-backup-$DATE.tar.gz" -C "$BACKUP_DIR" "temp-$DATE"
rm -rf "$BACKUP_DIR/temp-$DATE"

# Delete old backups
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name "npdi-backup-*.tar.gz" -mtime +$RETENTION_DAYS -delete

# Log
echo "$(date): Backup completed - npdi-backup-$DATE.tar.gz" >> "$BACKUP_DIR/backup.log"

# Optional: Upload to S3 or cloud storage
# aws s3 cp "$BACKUP_DIR/npdi-backup-$DATE.tar.gz" s3://your-bucket/backups/
```

Make executable:
```bash
chmod +x /home/deploy/backup-npdi.sh
```

**Schedule with Cron:**

```bash
crontab -e

# Add line (runs daily at 2 AM):
0 2 * * * /home/deploy/backup-npdi.sh
```

#### **29.2 Application Code Backup**

**Git Repository:**

Ensure code is committed and pushed:

```bash
cd /var/www/npdi-app
git status  # Should be clean
git push origin main
```

**File System Backup:**

```bash
# Backup entire application directory
tar -czf /home/deploy/npdi-app-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz \
  --exclude='node_modules' \
  --exclude='*.log' \
  /var/www/npdi-app

# Backup environment files separately (secure location)
sudo tar -czf /root/npdi-env-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz \
  /var/www/npdi-app/server/.env
```

#### **29.3 Recovery Procedures**

**Restore Database:**

```bash
# Stop application
pm2 stop npdi-app

# Extract backup
cd /home/deploy/npdi-backups
tar -xzf npdi-backup-20240115-020000.tar.gz

# Restore to MongoDB
mongorestore --db npdi-portal --drop temp-20240115-020000/npdi-portal

# Start application
pm2 start npdi-app

# Verify
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

**Restore Application:**

```bash
# Stop application
pm2 stop npdi-app

# Backup current state
sudo mv /var/www/npdi-app /var/www/npdi-app.old

# Extract backup
sudo tar -xzf /home/deploy/npdi-app-backup-20240115.tar.gz -C /var/www/

# Restore environment file
sudo tar -xzf /root/npdi-env-backup-20240115.tar.gz -C /

# Reinstall dependencies (if needed)
cd /var/www/npdi-app/server && npm install
cd /var/www/npdi-app/client && npm run build

# Start application
pm2 start npdi-app
```

**Disaster Recovery Plan:**

1. **Incident Detection:** Monitoring alerts indicate critical failure
2. **Assessment:** Determine scope and cause of failure
3. **Communication:** Notify stakeholders of outage
4. **Isolation:** Stop affected services
5. **Recovery:** Restore from most recent backup
6. **Verification:** Test all functionality
7. **Resume:** Bring system back online
8. **Post-Mortem:** Document incident and prevention measures

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** 4 hours  
**Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** 24 hours (daily backups)

#### **29.4 Backup Testing**

**Regularly test backups:**

```bash
# Monthly backup restoration test (in test environment)

# 1. Create test MongoDB instance
mongod --dbpath /tmp/test-mongo --port 27018 &

# 2. Restore backup to test instance
mongorestore --port 27018 --db npdi-portal-test \
  /home/deploy/npdi-backups/temp-20240115-020000/npdi-portal

# 3. Verify data
mongosh --port 27018 npdi-portal-test

db.productticketes.countDocuments()  # Should match production count
db.users.find().limit(5)             # Spot check data

# 4. Clean up
mongosh --port 27018
use npdi-portal-test
db.dropDatabase()
exit

pkill -f "mongod --dbpath /tmp/test-mongo"
```
